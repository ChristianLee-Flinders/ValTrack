# ValTrack
Welcome to the internal [**Robert Ellis**](https://www.robertellis.co.uk) Valuation tracking tool, utilising the Next.js framwwork.
This project is designed for internal use to track the progression of valuations, however we have long-term plans to **branch out** and offer it to external clients.

--- 

## Project Overview
**ValTrack** is a web based system designed to: 
- **Easily track and manage curent and past valuations**
- **Analyse Current market trends to best manage your team**
- **Automate valuation actions** eg. `Sending post valuation emails, texts & mailing lists`

The system is initially built for internal use by the [**Robert Ellis**](https://www.robertellis.co.uk/about-us/meet-the-team/) team. However, the goal is to refine the platform for broader market use and eventually **sell the solution as a SaaS** (Software as a Service) product.
