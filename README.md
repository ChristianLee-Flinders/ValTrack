# ValTrack
Welcome to the internal [**Robert Ellis**](https://www.robertellis.co.uk) Valuation tracking tool, utilising the Next.js framwwork.
This project is designed for internal use to track the progression of valuations, however we have long-term plans to **branch out** and offer it to external clients.
